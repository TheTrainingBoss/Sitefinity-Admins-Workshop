Changing Backend Themes
-----------------------

Sitefinity comes with an improved backend theme:

-   *Reduced top navigation*, to leave more room for the work area.

-   *Less graphics and color,* to remove unnecessary clutter and reduce
    distraction.

-   *More focus on content,* to improve the interaction with content and
    tasks.

-   *Increased emphasis on actions,* to make it faster and intuitive to
    complete user tasks.
