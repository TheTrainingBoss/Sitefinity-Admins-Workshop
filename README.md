Administrators
==============

> As an administrator, you will be configuring the Sitefinity website
> environment for content authors, designers and developers to work in.
> You want to give everyone the tools they need while still protecting
> security and resources. The sections that follow explain setup of key
> areas of the site like Ecommerce, email setup, modules, security and
> site management.

Email and Notification Configuration
------------------------------------

> Emails can be triggered by:

-   An administration action such as a password reset or signup email.

-   User action on content such as making a comment, creating an order
    or email from a campaign. These emails are *notifications*.

> Both administrative emails and notifications from content can use the
> exact same settings, but both should be filled out.
>
> Administrator generated emails are configured through Administration
> \> Settings \> Advanced. Select the System \> SMTP (Email Settings)
> node. Make sure that the SMTP server is entered in the Host text box
> and that the Port is correct for your server. Also enter the UserName
> and Password credentials for the server. Depending on the SMTP server
> requirements, you may need enter settings for *Domain*,
> *DeliveryMethod*, and *Enable SSL*.
>
> The SMTP server configuration is set at *Administration \> Settings \>
> Advanced \> Notifications \> Profiles \> Default*.

> The POP3 server can optionally respond to the temporary and permanent
> email delivery problems using *Soft bounce* and *Hard bounce* options.
> The Soft bounce options handle temporary problems such as when the
> recipient's mailbox is full, the email server is offline or the email
> is too large. Hard bounce responds to permanent delivery problems like
> incorrect email addresses, a bad domain name or if the recipient's
> server blocks email delivery.

-   *Time of day*: defines an interval of time during which visitors are
    considered to be users of the segment.

-   *Role*: the role of the user in the Sitefinity system.

-   *Profile Fields*: Fields that define the user such as name,

Workflow
--------

> A workflow is an approval process for publishing documents. By
> default, there are no workflows, so you can publish a document
> directly without additional steps. A simple workflow might have just
> two steps, one to approve the document (perhaps a manager must review
> before the document is published) and the publishing step itself. At
> the other end of the spectrum, government organizations have strict
> protocols for publishing with many steps in their approval process.
>
> Workflows can include notification so that a manager receives an email
> when a document is waiting approval.
>
> Defining a Workflow
>
> To define a custom workflow:

1.  In the administration menu, click the *System \> Workflow* item.

2.  No workflow has been created yet, so click the *Define a workflow*

> selection.
>
> Approval before publishing is a single level of approval before the
> content is published and becomes available on the website. *2 levels
> of approval* before publishing is for organizations that need multiple
> levels of approval. If you select this option, you need to define the
> two roles that need to approve the content. The *No approval workflow*
> option allows the author to publish immediately without approval.

31 \| ADMINISTRATORS

> Earlier versions of Sitefinity weren't suited for continuous delivery.

-   Sitefinity configuration was tightly bound to the database. Guids in
    the database had to stay in sync with the XML configuration files.
    Moving a configuration file directly to production was likely to
    break the site.

-   You couldn't export dynamic modules that didn't already exist on the
    production server.

-   You couldn't transfer custom fields using Site Sync. You had to
    manually create custom fields on the target site.

> Now, Sitefinity configuration files are cleanly implemented, without

> to Site2.
>
> To enable site synchronization:

1.  The projects should be hosted in IIS. Configure the Sitefinity
    projects to work in your version of IIS using the steps in the
    documentation foun[d
    here.](http://www.sitefinity.com/documentation/documentationarticles/installation-and-administration-guide/install-sitefinity/configuring-the-iis-to-host-sitefinity-projects)

2.  Run both sites and login to the backend of each.

> 32 \| ADMINISTRATORS

3.  By default, site synchronization is not installed or active so your
    first step will be to select the Administration \> Modules &
    Services menu option. Click the Install option in the Actions menu
    of the Staging and Syncing item. Do this for both sites.

4.  [Create a new user](#Creating_a_User) from the *Administration \>
    Users* menu option. This user will only be used for site
    synchronization and will never be logged in. The user should have
    the Administrator role. Do this for both sites and make the name
    unique for each site, e.g. SiteSyncIUser1 and SiteSyncUser2.

5.  Now select the new menu item *Administration \> Staging and Syncing*
    for both sites.

Alternative Publishing
----------------------

> Alternative publishing refers to funneling information from all kinds
> of sources such as events, blogs, email, or even external sources like
> Twitter feeds, and then publishing that data in a new format such as
> RSS (Really Simple Syndication), Sitefinity content (news, events,
> blogs, list items) or as a new Twitter feed. You can even mash
> together different sources of data.
>
> All this funneling collects the incoming data to an area called a
> publishing point. Often the data will have a large number of fields,
> and, depending on the source of the data, these fields will have
> different names. The process of mapping determines what fields are
> used and where the data for each field should go. Mapping occurs on
> the inbound trip to the publishing point and on the outbound journey
> to be published.
>
> Alternative publishing can be automatic, such as is the case for
> forums. When you create a new forum the Alternative Publishing area
> Generate RSS feed is enabled by default.

5.  Shipping offline requires that you set the shipping cost
    specifically. In the Shipping price area, you can base the price on
    Weight, Total price, Fixed price per order, Fixed percentage of the
    total price or Quantity. This example uses the Fixed percentage of
    total price option with Shipping price set to 10%.

> Payment Methods
>
> Payment methods describe how orders will be paid for: online with a
> credit card or offline where you handle the payment arrangements.
>
> Creating an Online Payment Method
>
> Online payment methods describe how a commercial payment processor
> like PayPal or Authorize.Net AIM handle your site's credit card
> transactions. Online payment processing services typically have live
> accounts for production online ordering and test accounts to help
> verify that your processing will be correct.
>
> Each payment processor has its own set of information that must be
> entered in Sitefinity's payment type. Typically, the payment processor
> supplies you with a URL of a service that performs the processing and
> some kind of authentication such as login id or vendor name. The
> payment processor developer documentation may also supply test credit
> card numbers that will not charge an account but will pass validation.
>
> For example, you can sign up at the Authorize.Net developer center for
> a test account at
> [https://developer.authorize.net/testaccount/.](https://developer.authorize.net/testaccount/)
> Here's an example walk-through that uses Authorize.Net AIM to create
> an online payment type:

1.  Sign up for a new account at
    [[https://developer.authorize.net/testaccount/]{.underline}.](https://developer.authorize.net/testaccount/)
    Collect the login ID and Transaction key they provide.

2.  In Sitefinity, select the *Ecommerce \> Payment methods* menu
    option.

3.  Click the *Create a payment method* link.

4.  Enter a Name for the method, for example, Credit Card.

6.  The Payment processor drop down list selection cascades to set the
    allowed credit cards and required authentication settings.

7.  Select the check boxes for credit card types you will accept on your
    site. For now, leave the Mode radio button at Test. Set the URL to
    [[https://test.authorize.net/gateway/transact.dll]{.underline}.](https://test.authorize.net/gateway/transact.dll)
    Enter the Login ID and Transaction key supplied by the developer
    site.

Responsive Web Design
---------------------

> Your web design is expected to look good on standard desktop displays,
> iPhones, Androids, tablets or any device used during the life of your
> website. Sitefinity automatically arranges the layout of the screen
> based on the current screen characteristics (i.e. screen size, device
> to pixel ratio, orientation, etc.). If your large, browser-based
> layout takes up three columns from side to side, the iPhone can view
> the same content running in a single column. You can even customize
> font properties or swap images based on the current screen
> characteristics.
>
> Sitefinity implements responsive web design automatically, using rules
> to define the characteristics to look for (e.g. 240-320 pixels in
> width like the HTC Wildfire) and how your site should react (e.g.
> transform the layout, redirect to another site, or load a special
> CSS).
>
> Under the hood, Sitefinity uses CSS media queries to get information
> about the screen minimum width and orientation. For more background
> information, check out Ethan Marcotte\'s seminal blog [[Responsive Web
> Design]{.underline}.](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/)
>
> Creating Rules
>
> The first step is to create rules for the scenarios you expect to
> encounter. In our example, we\'ll create a small version of a simple
> website. You can make rules for as many detailed cases as you want.
> Typically, you\'ll want to cover small \"Smart phone\" screens,
> tablets and large notebook/desktop screens.
>
> To begin building a responsive web site, first create the group rules
> and the layout that should result.

1.  From the Sitefinity menu, select *Design \> Responsive & Mobile*
    design.

2.  Click the *Create a group of rules* button.

3.  Enter a *Name* for the group of rules.

6.  In the *System settings* section, select the vertical arrangement of
    rows for each option. For example, where the default is *3 colum*ns,
    select *3 rows*.

> Tips for Using Master Pages
>
> You will need to perform some \"surgery\" to make the theme useful in
> Sitefinity. Using master pages inside a Sitefinity website involves
> three main pieces:

-   The master age itself. The master page file and its associated
    code-behind live in the App\_Master folder of the Visual Studio
    project.

-   The theme contains style related files, i.e. css, JavaScript and
    images.

-   The Sitefinity template is stored in the Sitefinity database. The
    template ties together the Master page and the Theme. The template
    is based on the master page and the theme is applied to the
    template. The CarConduit files are included with projects with this
    book.

> In Visual Studio, you will need to edit the master file to work with
> Sitefinity. Once the general areas are setup in the master page, use
> the template in Sitefinity to further subdivide layout elements and to
> add common content. Develop the layout to fit your requirements, then
> create areas for customization using the ContentPlaceHolder control.
>
> Here are some tips for performing "surgery" on the master page:

-   Remove everything from the inside of the \<head\> tag. Sitefinity
    will take care of meta tags and style sheet references for us, so
    the \<head\> tag elements are not needed. You will need the \<head\>
    tag itself, so do not remove it.

-   Add the attribute runat=\"server\" to the \<head\> tag. Sitefinity
    needs to access the head tag at the server and failing to do this
    will cause a \"yellow screen of death\" error.

-   Make sure there is only one \<form\> tag on the page, that it is
    just inside the

> \<body\> tag and that it has the runat="server" attribute and value.

-   Analyze the page looking for areas of the page that have hard-coded
    text. Replace areas of hard-coded text with ContentPlaceHolder
    controls. For example:

> \<div id=\"navigation\"\>
>
> \<asp:contentplaceholder id=\"Navigation\" runat=\"server\" /\>
>
> \</div\>
>
> **Note**: Be sure to use *ContentPlaceHolder*, not *Placeholder*.
>
> To make the template general-purpose, add ContentPlaceHolder controls
> to any area of the master page you\'ll want to customize later. Try to

Sitefinity Feather
------------------

> The *Sitefinity Feather* module is a collection of resources and
> conventions to simplify the creation and management of widgets,
> layouts, and templates. Feather allows you to use convention-based,
> mobile-first UI frameworks with your Sitefinity site. The most popular
> of all these frontend frameworks is Bootstrap, but Feather also
> supports other frontend framework such as Semantic UI and Foundation.
>
> Feather is a free module, built into Sitefinity and is enabled by
> default on new Sitefinity installations. Feather adds a complete
> framework to take control the site's layout and markup. In this
> section we'll review a few of the features relevant to designers
> provided by Feather.
>
> **Note**: Although the technology behind Feather is the ASP.NET MVC
> development framework, the features available to designers involve
> little to no programming effort and can be leveraged by following the
> required conventions which we'll look at in the next section.
>
> 158 \| DESIGNERS
>
> MVC Stock Widgets
>
> Feather includes a collection of MVC versions of the stock Sitefinity
> widgets such as Blogs, News, Events, etc. These versions are
> lightweight, mobile-friendly, and load quickly with efficient, clean
> markup and can be differentiated from the default widgets in the
> toolbox by the MVC icon in the corner.

height="3.65625in"}

> Widget Designer Framework
>
> You can create custom widget designers using a brand new framework
> based on AngularJS. Included is a wide assortment of Angular
> Directives that make it simple to enable Sitefinity related field
> controls to your designer, including selectors for Pages, Images,
> Documents and even your custom module items.
>
> The extensibility of widget designers offered by Feather also enables
> you to tap into a rich style collection to simplify your design, and
> even allows you to add custom commands to your widget beyond the
> included Editor.

161 \| DESIGNERS

> Convention-based customization
>
> Feather offers an intuitive convention for customizing and creating
> widget and layout templates. Simply create a file in the proper
> location and the MVC widgets and designers will have immediate access
> to the new templates.
>
> The Bootstrap template package is included out of the box, and
> additional packages supporting Foundation and Semantic UI are also
> available via
> [GitHub.](https://github.com/Sitefinity/feather-packages) You can even
> create your own packages to reuse across multiple Sitefinity websites.
> Sitefinity Page Templates are created from these packages
> automatically, so you can immediately benefit from the new MVC layouts
> on your pages.
>
> Templating via Routing
>
> Feather uses a clever routing technique to make it easy to decide
> which templates to override and from where. Templates assigned from a
> Resource Package have the highest priority, then fall back to the root
> Mvc folder and finally back to the embedded resources, allowing you to
> override some or all templates by simply creating a file in the
> appropriate location.
>
> 162 \| DESIGNERS
>
> Layout Widget Templates
>
> Another feature enabled by the Feather module is the set of layout
> templates from the different UI Resource Packages (Bootstrap,
> Foundation, Semantic UI). These are found in the Template section of
> the sidebar of the page editor, and allow you to apply grids and
> columns to your pages, based on the framework of your choice.

> Resource Packages
>
> Layout templates are actually sourced from a folder in the Sitefinity
> project root named ResourcePackages. Within each package folder is a
> collection of templates that can be automatically assigned to your
> pages, widgets, and designers associated with the pages created using
> the package.
>
> In addition to containing templates, ResourcePackages can also contain
> the styles, scripts, images and other content required to style your
> page. By following a simple naming convention, your page templates
> will automatically be enhanced by the appropriate package.

Creating Page Templates from MVC Layout Files
---------------------------------------------

> Feather allows you to create Page Templates in the backend based on an
> MVC layout file (instead of the usual Webforms Master Page). Simply
> place a layout file in the appropriate Mvc folder and Feather will
> automatically create the associated Sitefinity page template.
>
> You can then extend the template, adding new ContentPlaceHolders and
> other markup by modifying the appropriate backing layout file.

-   **ResourcePackages**: If the backing Page or Page Template that
    contains the widget is based on an MVC template from a Resource
    Package, it will first search the Mvc folder of that package on the
    file system and serve the matching templates for each widget found
    in that location. If you are not using a Resource Package template,
    this area is skipped and not searched.

-   **Root Mvc folder**: If no matching templates are defined in the
    Resource Package Mvc folder (or if the template is not based on a
    Resource Package) Feather will attempt to locate views in the root
    \~/Mvc/Views folder of the web application.

-   **Sitefinity Widget Templates**: If no matching templates are
    defined in the file system, Feather will then search for a matching
    template in the backend list of templates (located under the
    Design \> Widget Templates menu).

-   **Embedded Resources**: Finally, if no custom templates are found in
    any of the custom locations, Feather will serve the default,
    embedded resources from the Feather module itself.

1.  Click the *Create a template* button.

2.  In the following screen select the option for *News (MVC)*.

3.  Copy and paste the markup from the above template into the editor.

4.  Make sure the name of the template is prefixed with "List." followed

6.  Click *Create this template*.

7.  Repeat steps 1-6, using the prefix "Detail." in step 4.

8.  Open or create a page in the Page Editor to contain the news widget.

9.  From the toolbox, drag the News widget with the MVC icon into a
    placeholder.

10. Click *Edit* in the newly placed widget to open its property editor.

11. Click the header for List settings, revealing the custom template
    option.

12. Select this template.

13. Click the header for Single item settings, revealing the custom
    template option.

14. Select the custom template.

15. Click *Save*.

>
> The naming convention requires that you place the view in a folder
> that matches the name of the widget (such as "News", "Events",
> "VideoGallery", etc.) and name the file to match the type of view

Widget Designers
----------------

> When building custom widgets, you likely have a set of properties that
> need to be set by editing the properties of the widget on the page.
> Sitefinity does provide a default editor interface for your widgets,
> exposing any public properties for edit. However, this editor is a
> simple one, showing only a textbox input for all fields, regardless
> their underlying type.

> Previous to Feather, Sitefinity Thunder attempted to improve things by
> generating designers based on existing widgets, creating the code
> files and templates necessary to render more interactive inputs and
> selectors. However, the components required were numerous and
> cumbersome, and the generated code was verbose and error prone.

181 \| DESIGNERS

> Fortunately, all of this is alleviated with the introduction of
> Feather, which adds a complete framework for creating designers for
> your widgets. Like most of the customization provided by Feather, it
> relies on conventions for naming and placing your designer templates
> in the right location.
>
> Widget Designers Naming Convention
>
> The naming convention for widget designers is similar to the frontend
> portion of the widget template we've already seen, but the prefix for
> the view is "DesignerView". To demonstrate this, we'll create a very
> simple MVC widget designer for the news widget.
>
> Now that we have a widget with some properties, let's proceed to
> create a designer.

1.  Navigate to the path *\~/Mvc/Views*.

2.  Create a new folder called *News*.

3.  Create a file in the folder named *DesignerView.MyDesigner.cshtml*.

4.  Add the following markup to the file's contents:

> *\<p\>Hello from my custom designer!\</p\>*
>
> To see the custom designer in action, open a page which contains the
> news widget and click *Edit* to manage its properties. This action
> reveals the standard designer, but at the bottom of the default
> designer will be a new button pointing to your custom template.

> **Note**: Although this sample reveals how simple it is to create and
> modify a custom designer, it obviously lacks all the operation
> necessary to service the backing widget, which is a developer task.
> For more details on how to create a full-featured designer for
> existing and custom widgets, see the Sitefinity for Developers book.
>
> Prioritizing the Custom Designer
>
> Instead of making your designer an option, you can configure
> Sitefinity to load your designer by default. To do this, simply create
> a file alongside the template, named to match exactly except using the
> extension .json, and add the following contents:
>
> {
>
> \"priority\": 1
>
> }
>
> For our example, we would create the file
> *DesignerView.MyDesigner.json* and place it in the same folder. Next
> time we load the editor we'll automatically see our custom designer
> template.
